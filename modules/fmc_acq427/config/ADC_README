Order of operations to begin data capture on ACQ427 Module

  Set a suitable clock divider.
    PandA clk_0 is 125 MHz. Max sample rate of ADC is 1 MHz.
    Set clock A period to 1e-6 and connect to PCAP block CAPTURE port
    
    Example of clock configuration
    
    Target sample rate of 1 MHz
    Internal PandA clock = 125 MHz
    Set ADC clock divide to 125, 125 / 125 = 1 MHz
    
  Set FMC Channel Data CAPTURE to "Triggered"
    
  Set configuration bits in the following order
    Set MODULE_ENABLE
    Set ADC_CLKDIV
    Assert then Deassert ADC_FIFO_RESET
    Set ADC_ENABLE
    Set ADC_FIFO_ENABLE

  Data should now be acquiring on the ACQ427. Available to view via the web interface or through standard PCAP acquisition.
