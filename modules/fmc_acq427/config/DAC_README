Order of operations to begin data output on ACQ427 DAC Module

  Set a suitable clock divider.
    We divide PandA clk_0 by 2 to get the source clock for 427 DAC logic. Max sample rate of DAC is 1 MHz.
    
    Example of clock configuration
    
    Target update rate of 1 MHz
    Internal ACQ427 DAC clock = 62.5 MHz
    Set DAC clock divide to 62, 62.5M / 62 ~= 1 MHz
    
  Source DAC data from counter
    Set clock A period to 1e-6 and connect to counters block TRIG port
    Set FMC Channel Data to "COUNTER1.OUT"
    Set a sensible counter STEP
    
  Set configuration bits in the following order
    Set MODULE_ENABLE
    Set DAC_CLKDIV (62)
    --N.B. The following 4 steps are required on every power cycle. The act of asserting and de-asserting reset performs some initialisation SPI writes to the DACs
    Ensure DAC_ENABLE is Disabled
    Assert then Deassert DAC_RESET
    Set DAC_ENABLE
    Set DAC_FIFO_ENABLE

  Data should now be updating on the ACQ427 outputs.
