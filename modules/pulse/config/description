PULSE       One-shot pulse delay and stretch
    DELAY           Output pulse delay (0 for no delay)
    WIDTH           Output pulse width (0 for input pulse width)
    INP             Input pulse train
    ENABLE          Reset on falling edge, enable on rising
    OUT             Output pulse train
    PERR            Pulse error 
    ERR_OVERFLOW    Missed pulse was due to overflow of internal queue
    ERR_PERIOD      Producing a pulse would cause it to overlap with previous
    QUEUE           Length of the delay queue
    MISSED_CNT      Number of pulses not produced because of an ERR condition
