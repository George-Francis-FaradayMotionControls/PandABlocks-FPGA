Order of operations to begin data capture on ACQ430 Module

  Set a suitable clock divider.
    Final sample rate will depend on source clock, clock divider and ADC Mode.
    ADC Mode = 0 (High Speed Mode) introduces a sigma-delta divide of 256. This mode should be employed when desired sample rate is > 48 kHz
    ADC Mode = 1 (High Resolution Mode) introduces a sigma-delta divide of 512. This mode should be employed when desired sampe rate is < 48 kHz
    
    Example of clock configuration
    
    Target sample rate of 122 kHz
    Internal PandA clock = 125 MHz
    Set clock divide to 4, 125 / 4 = 31.25 MHz
    Set ADC mode to High Speed, 31.35 / 256 = 122 kHz
    
    For other sample rates the user will have to design this calculation.
    Alternatively the external FMC clock can be selected and set to a divide of 1. In this case only the sigma-delta divide will apply.
    
    It would also be sensible to set the PCAP clock to match the ACQ430 sample rate to avoid oversampling or subsampling.

  Set configuration bits in the following order
    Set MODULE_ENABLE
    Set ADC_MODE
    Set ADC_CLKDIV
    Assert then Deassert ADC_FIFO_RESET
    Set ADC_ENABLE
    Set ADC_FIFO_ENABLE

  Data should now be acquiring on the ACQ430. Available to view via the web interface or through standard PCAP acquisition.
