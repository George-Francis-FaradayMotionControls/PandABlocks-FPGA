BITS        Soft inputs and constant bits
    A               The value that output A should take
    B               The value that output B should take
    C               The value that output C should take
    D               The value that output D should take
    OUTA            The value of A on the bit bus
    OUTB            The value of B on the bit bus
    OUTC            The value of C on the bit bus
    OUTD            The value of D on the bit bus
    ZERO            The constant value 0 on the bit bus
    ONE             The constant value 1 on the bit bus
