PCOMP       Position compare
    PRE_START       INP must be this far from START before waiting for START
    START           Pulse absolute/relative start position value
    WIDTH           The relative distance between a rising and falling edge
    STEP            The relative distance between successive rising edges
    PULSES          The number of pulses to produce, 0 means infinite
    RELATIVE        If 1 then START is relative to the position of INP at enable
    DIR             Direction to apply all relative offsets to
    ENABLE          Stop on falling edge, reset and enable on rising edge
    INP             Position data from position-data bus
    ACTIVE          Active output is high while block is in operation
    OUT             Output pulse train
    HEALTH          Error details if anything goes wrong
    PRODUCED        The number of pulses produced
