PCAP        Position capture control
    ENABLE          After arm, when high start capture, when low disarm
    GATE            After enable, only process gated values if high
    CAPTURE         On selected edge capture current value and gated data
    CAPTURE_EDGE    Which edge of capture input signal triggers capture
    SHIFT_SUM       Shift sum data, use if > 2**32 samples required in sum/average
    HEALTH          Was last capture successful?
    ACTIVE          Data capture in progress
    TS_START        Timestamp of first gate high in current capture relative to enable
    TS_END          Timestamp of last gate high + 1 in current capture relative to enable
    TS_CAPTURE      Timestamp of capture event relative to enable
    SAMPLES         Number of gated samples in the current capture
    BITS0           Quadrant 0 of bit_bus
    BITS1           Quadrant 1 of bit_bus
    BITS2           Quadrant 2 of bit_bus
